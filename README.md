# external_sources

This repository just holds some external sources for Metwork Framework builds.

**It's a kind of software distribution. No derived work here. 

Maybe some static builds for specific edge cases but mainly untouched softwares source archives
for softwares with slow or unreliable public download links.

No branch or versionning here:

- we don't update files
- we don't delete files (or really old and deprecated ones)

Because it's just a kind of public mirror, there is no specific license here or copyrights. 

**Each software here belongs to its authors and is subject to its own license.**
